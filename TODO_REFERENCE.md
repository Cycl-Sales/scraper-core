# Cycl Sales Dashboard - TODO Reference

## Development Tasks

### TODO:
- [x] **Locations Table** -> Find the code that displays more information about the column when the user clicks on the question mark (?) icon
- [x] **http://localhost:3000/analytics?location_id=MSznPRZ3VKFNfJK2kViV** -> Should the location component be a selection of available locations displayed in overview page ONLY if the user is agency, otherwise, keep the current state where it's not clickable
- [x] **More Filter isn't working on Analytics page**
- [ ] **Make the Calls tab functional** where it displays all the calls made under the location (Contact/Call) switch
- [ ] **For each analysis fields such as AI Status, AI Quality Grade, AI Sales Grade**, there should be their own function when calling the AI. The AI must respond with:
  1. Summary Label
  2. Summary Temperature (This is our way to determine the color of the chip in the frontend)
  3. Full-detail summary with key points (I think this should be an HTML value)
- [ ] **On the contacts table, the Contact Name should not scroll horizontally**. This should work similar to the Location table. In that table the Location Name does not scroll horizontally which is super cool.
- [ ] **Update the Determine Contact Status automation**
